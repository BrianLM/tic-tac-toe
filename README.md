# The game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a 3-in-a-row game. Match your token across any row to win.

## The tech

This SPA page was written with Javascript, jQuery, SCSS, HTML5, and CSS Styling from Bootstrap.

## The planning


## With the user in mind
- 'As a user I can sign up to log in and store my progress'
- 'As a user I can give up if I know I will lose.'
- 'As a user I can log in any time to go back to my game.'
- 'As a user I can change my password.'

### Wireframe
